# ScoreBoard
For storing matches a List collection is used.  
It allows to store information about the order in which matches were started (which is one of requirement).  
If (for example for better efficiency) there will be need to change the List to a different type of Collection - e.g. the HashMap, then adding additional information about match start time will be needed.
